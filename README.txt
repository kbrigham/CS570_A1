Assignment #1, 

File manifest:
A1.cpp
A1.h
makefile

Compile instructions:
Enter make command. The make file will compile A1.cpp and create SEM executable.

Operating instructions: (include any/all command line options/arguments, required inputs, etc)
Once the makefile has run, enter SEM to execute program

List/description of novel/significant design decisions:
A1.cpp-Contains main and methods within main.
A1.h-Contains all includes, definitions, and 
makefile-includes -lpthread and -lposix4 library, creates exec. 

List/description of any extra features/algorithms/functionality :
N/A

List/description of all known deficiencies or bugs: 
No known deficiencies or bugs. 

Lessons Learned: The POSIX library is system dependent and using an IDE such as Eclipse is not efficient due to time spent configuring software.
